            <h3 class="">Tuesday</h3>
            <p>
                Going through the forest is my favourite part of the walk. My dog Benji loves it too. I’m Grace. I live
                on a
                farm with my parents and I take Benji for a walk most days after school. While Benji’s playing, I stop
                to
                take a
                photo of a butterfly. I’m thinking about posting it on Facebook, but then I hear Benji barking. He’s
                jumping
                and
                running around a boy. The poor boy looks worried. 'Benji, stop! Come here!' I call and throw him his
                ball.
                I’m
                about to say sorry to the boy, but he’s gone.

            <h3>Thursday</h3>
            <p>
                I can’t find Mark, so I shout, 'Mark, where are you?'<br>
                No answer. <br>
                'Mark,' I shout again, 'I know about you.' <br>
                After a moment, he appears. 'What do you know? How do you know my name?' <br>
                'Your dad was on TV. The police are looking for you.' <br>
                He looks shocked. 'Did you say anything? Have you told them?' <br>
                'No,' I say. 'I wanted to talk to you first. What’s happened? Why have you run away?' <br>
                'I had an argument with my dad. A bad one.' <br>
                'What about?' I ask. <br>
                Mark points to a fallen tree and we sit down. <br>
                'My mum died four years ago. It was a very difficult time for me and for Dad. He was sad for a long
                time,
                but
                then he met someone new. Mel’s her name.'
                <br>
                'Oh, and don’t you like her?' I ask. <br>
                'No, not much. She’s not a bad person, but we don’t really connect. She wants my dad for herself and she
                isn’t
                interested in me.'
                <br>
                'But, what about your dad? Have you talked to him?' <br>
                'He tells me to try harder with her, but I can’t. The night I ran away, he told me that we’re all moving
                to
                London. Mel’s from London, you see. Then he told me that he and Mel want to get married and have a baby.
                We
                both
                got angry and I told him I’m not moving to London. I took my tent and I left in the middle of the
                night.'
                <br>
                'But what will you do? You can’t live here.' I tell him. <br>
                'I know, but my grandad and my friends are in Manchester. I don’t want to move to London.' <br>
                'You might like London,' I say. <br>
                'That’s what my dad says.' <br>
                I feel sorry for Mark, but I think of his dad crying on TV and feel sorry for him too. <br>
                'What are you going to do?' I ask. <br>
                'I don’t know. I need time to think.' <br>

        <h3>Wednesday</h3>
        <p>
                It’s cold today, so Benji and I are walking fast. As we go through the forest, it starts raining so I
                run.
                Suddenly, I fall and I’m on my back. OUCH! That hurt!<br>
                <br>
                Then there’s someone there and a voice asks 'Are you all right?' I look up and see the boy from
                yesterday.
                <br>
                'I’m OK,' I say and the boy helps me up. <br>
                'I haven’t seen you at school. Do you live near here?' I ask. <br>
                'No, I’m from Manchester,' he says. 'Sorry! I have to go. Can you walk? Do you need help?' <br>
                'No, I’m fine. Thanks!' I say and the boy walks away. <br>
                'I’m Grace,' I call. 'What’s your name?' but he’s already gone. <br>
                <br>
                At home, Mum’s watching the news. <br>
                'Hi Grace. Do you know about this boy, Mark?' she asks. <br>
                'No, what boy?' I say. <br>
                'A boy from Manchester. He’s run away from home. Look! This is his dad.' <br>
                There’s a man on TV sitting with a policeman. He’s crying as the policeman asks people to help. Then
                they
                show a
                photo of the missing boy. It’s the boy from the forest. He’s Mark. Should I say something?
                <br>
                'Poor man,' says Mum. 'I just hope they find his son soon.' <br>
                No, I mustn’t say anything. If I tell Mum, the police will come and find Mark. What if he’s run away for
                a
                good
                reason? I should talk to him first.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>
                Mark’s waiting for me in the forest. I’ve got some news. <br>
                'The police came to the farm this morning. They’re going to search the forest tomorrow.' <br>
                Mark looks sad, 'I didn’t want this. My dad, crying on TV and the police looking for me. I don’t know
                what
                to
                do.'
                <br>
                'I’ve got an idea. Why don’t you live with your grandad in Manchester? Let your dad and Mel move to
                London
                and
                visit them in the holidays.'
                <br>
                Mark doesn’t answer at first, then he looks at me and smiles. <br>
                'Can I use your phone?' he asks. 'I need to call my dad.' <br>
